			<p> Finding herself stressed out and overworked, this is one New Yorker's journey on a quest to learn work/life balance. Such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> cooking without setting off the fire alarm </li>
					<li> what is this thing called "free time" </li>
					<li> the power of sleeping </li>
				</ul>

		<p id="moreabout">This is my personal blog as I embark on a journey from overworked manhattan commuter to Denver out-doors-liking-person. In the process I've begun learning to cook.. briefly lived off a microwave while my belongings got stuck on a moving truck for many weeks, then resumed cooking again. I'm getting into hiking, when in Colorado I guess! I was at the end of my rope and losing my wits, but I'll always be Jwitz: the terrible cook. Well.. hopefully eventually Jwitz the not-so-terrible cook. Well..at least Jwitz: the sometimes cooks and usually it's edible..cook.</p>
