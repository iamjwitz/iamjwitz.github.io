			<p> Finding herself stressed out and overworked, this is one New Yorker's journey on a quest to learn work/life balance. Such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> cooking without setting off the fire alarm </li>
					<li> what is this thing called "free time" </li>
					<li> the power of sleeping </li>
				</ul>
		</aside>
		<p>This is my personal blog as I ebmark on a journey from overworked manhattan commuter to Denver out-doors-liking-person. In the process I've begun cooking, paused cooking while my belongings got stuck on a moving truck for many weeks, then resumed cooking again. Cardio is hard this close to the mountains, but eventually I'll attempt that as well. I was at the end of my rope and losing my wits, but I'll always be Jwitz: the terrible cook. Well.. hopefully eventually the not-so-terrible cook. At least Jwitz: the can feed people</p>
