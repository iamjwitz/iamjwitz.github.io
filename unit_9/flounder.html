			<h2>floundering in the kitchen</h2>
			
			<p>The other night I stayed with my parents and my dad offered to cook dinner but we thought it would be more fun to work together. All of a sudden I hear a yell from the kitchen.. "I'm floundering here!! Come help!! Man was he proud of that pun.. For the flounder we used some of my absolute fave spices by Flavor god. I know pre-mixed spices is a TOTAL faux pas to many who cook, but alas I need all the help I can get! I'm a fan of the "classic combo pack". One of my go-to moves is roasted vegetables with the lemon-garlic seasoning. SO GOOD. Back when I made chicken a lot I would switch up the flavors on every few pieces so I wouldn't get bored throughout the week. It's a TAD confusing to bite into what you think is honey bbq but get everything spicy, but eh I live on the edge. 

				Anyway, back to the flounder. It was good! The best part was I watched while someone else did the heavy lifting.. We went simple here with some microwaves veggies and cauliflower "mashed potatoes". Flounder is sometimes a bit too fishy for me, so the simple flavors of the sides helped balance it all out.

			<p> Finding herself stressed out and overworked, this is one New Yorker's journey on a quest to learn work/life balance. Such as:</p>
