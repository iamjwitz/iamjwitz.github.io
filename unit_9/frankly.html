			<h2>Frankly, My Dear...</h2>
			<p>Cheer's m'dears! Once upon a time I went to a one-man show. Said one-man show was.. how should I put it.. frankly... terrible. Not terribe, the drinks at the Blue Bar at the Algonquin Hotel. Firstly, I feel so fancy just saying 'ah yes we went to drinks at the Algonquin after a one-man play about who knows what where he tried to tap dance at weird times'. Secondly, the drinks were out of this world. And they had to be.. that show was.. out. of. this. world. We gathered round and sipped out cocktails and rehashed what on earth we had just been through. Everything was blue (da ba di da ba dai) and it all felt very chic. I try to keep an eye on my diet, but this was one of those nights where it's about the lifestyle, not the diet. Someitmes, you just need a burger and a post theatre martini. Then skilttles on the train home while taking a fantastic nap.
