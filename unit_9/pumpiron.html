			<h2>Pick things up and put them down</h2>
			
			<p>Ever meet a Diva who changed your life? I did... I was once on a hunt for a personal trainer. I stumbled upon this badass woman through buzzfeed who refers to herself as a Diva and I was sold! Turns out, said Diva is a plus size pole dancer and all about body positivty...

				I was doing my go-to anxiously stare at the website then talk myself out of reaching out thing when one of her videos caught my eye. She said something along the lines of "to those who think I'm not a role model, know that I practice what I preach. I preach drinking top shelf liquor *takes a swig* I preach positivity and inclusivenes..." now thats a trainer I can get on board with. I've tried everything you can think of in the past (except dance classes.. no one wants to see that) and never felt like I was in the right place. I have found my Diva.

				This day was special. After about a year together and a dozen goals I hit a big one. A few months earlier Roz taught me to deadlift - right along side the beefy bros at the meathead gym downtown. As soon as I lifted I realized I not only loved it, but wanted to lift more than me. This day, I did it. I did the damn thing. I picked that shit up. Then I put it down. It was glorious. 

				What Roz taught me was more than fitness (although there was a ton of skillsharing there too). It was how to work out in a superhero cape on Haloween. It was how to dance like no one's watching when you land a box jump you thought you couldn't. It's to walk into any gym any time and do the damn thing.

			<p> Finding herself stressed out and overworked, this is one New Yorker's journey on a quest to learn work/life balance. Such as:</p>
